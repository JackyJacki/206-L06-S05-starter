          <h2>About me!</h2>
          <p><strong>Hi, I'm Jackie Liborio.</strong> With a passion for fostering growth and learning, I currently work as a leader at a local grocery store and I am learning to make a career change to become a front-end developer.
            With my leadership skills I believe I'll be able to someday help others learn the skills that I am currentl learning. I tend to really learn things the more I do them so, with time and experience I'll be able to really get the hang of the developer skills.
            I am learning how to create user friendly websites that anyone could get into whether on a phone or on a tablet. Seeing all the conent moving around as I am working on the css is amazing to see and keeps me going and focused. Eager to embrace this new chapter, I am committed to continuous learning and contributing to the
            ever-evolving world of web development.</p>
